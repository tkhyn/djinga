# Buildout main config file

# WARNING: for performance reason, especially when the buildout command is
# invoked in a mercurial hook, it must be run in a buildout-friendly virtual
# environment (with only buildout, setuptools and recipes eggs in site-packages)
# if not, the entire site-package directory will be hashed, which may take a
# considerable amount of time depending on the installed packages

# File includes:
# > use dependencies.cfg to set the eggs and their versions
# > use buildout/parts.cfg to configure the parts to be generated
# > use buildout/local.cfg (unversionned) to tweak the options (e.g. add develop
#   eggs from repositories, etc.) and adapt them to your machine / config
